# Energy Use

## Components of energy use

**Basal metabolism (BMR)**
- BMR minimal amount of energy needed to keep a fasting, resting body alive: 60-80%
- Thermic effect of food: 8-15%
- Physical activity: 15-30% (varies widely from person to person)

**Lean Body Mass (LBM)**
- people with higher amounts of lean body mass haeve a higher BMR
- Lean mass can vary greatly between people of the same weight

**Factors that increase or decrease BMR**
Increase
- illness or energy
- medical conditions
- hyeractive thyroid
- Greater body surface level (being tall)
- Growth (pregnancy, infancy, adolecense)
- lean body mass
- post exercise
- stimulants (caffiene)
- stress

Decrease
- Insufficient thyroid gland production
- short stature
- starvation, low calorie diets
- age, which makes weight loss hearder in later life (30+)

Being active is very important to help with maintaining LBM and keeping the BMR higher and healthier

## Section 2

### Determining Health Risks

Factors considered:
- total body weight
- total body fatness
- body mass index (BMI)
- waist cercumference
- body composition

**BMI Catergories**
UNDERWEIGHT < 18.5
NORMAL 18.5-24.9
OVERWEIGHT 25-29.9
OBESITY 30-34.9
OBESITY II 35-39.9
EXTREME OBESITY +40

While BMI is cheap and easy to do, it is not the best way to compare physiology

DEXA scan - most accurate
Bod pod (air displacement)
Bioelectric impedence)
Underwater weighing (water displacement)
Skinfold measurements

### Types of Obesity

#### Central/visceral fat
Males: apple, android obesity
- males are 10 years most advanced in health risks when obese

Females: pear, gynoid

Upper body fat is pretty bad, testosterone and alcohol encourage upperbody fat
**Risks**
Death from all causes increases
Cardiovascular disease
Type 2 diabetes
Some cancers

#### Subcutaneous fat
Below the skin
stored in thighs, buttocks, abdomen
acts as an insulation

### Measurements
alongside the machines listed above, a waist circumference will help indicate when problems of visceral fat happen

The greater the amount of fat in a body, the greater the risk for:
- gallstones
- fatty liver
- hypertension
- heart diseases
- type 2 diabetes
- certain cancers
- inflammation
- premature death
- infertility
- sleep apnea
- artritis

## Defining a healthy body weight

weight is a risk factor for chronic illness
impacts metabolic fitness


## Genetic Factors
Genetics play a strong role in our obesity
One obese parent gives offpsring 40% chance of obesity in adulthood
Two obese parents - 80% risk of obesity

Genetics cannot explain how the obesity rates have spiked in recent decades
