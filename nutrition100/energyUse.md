# Energy Use

## Components of energy use

**Basal metabolism (BMR)**
- BMR minimal amount of energy needed to keep a fasting, resting body alive: 60-80%
- Thermic effect of food: 8-15%
- Physical activity: 15-30% (varies widely from person to person)

**Lean Body Mass (LBM)**
- people with higher amounts of lean body mass haeve a higher BMR
- Lean mass can vary greatly between people of the same weight

**Factors that increase or decrease BMR**
Increase
- illness or energy
- medical conditions
- hyeractive thyroid
- Greater body surface level (being tall)
- Growth (pregnancy, infancy, adolecense)
- lean body mass
- post exercise
- stimulants (caffiene)
- stress

Decrease
- Insufficient thyroid gland production
- short stature
- starvation, low calorie diets
- age, which makes weight loss hearder in later life (30+)

Being active is very important to help with maintaining LBM and keeping the BMR higher and healthier

## Section 2

### Determining Health Risks

Factors considered:
- total body weight
- total body fatness
- body mass index (BMI)
- waist cercumference
- body composition

**BMI Catergories**
UNDERWEIGHT < 18.5
NORMAL 18.5-24.9
OVERWEIGHT 25-29.9
OBESITY 30-34.9
OBESITY II 35-39.9
EXTREME OBESITY +40

While BMI is cheap and easy to do, it is not the best way to compare physiology

DEXA scan - most accurate
Bod pod (air displacement)
Bioelectric impedence)
Underwater weighing (water displacement)
Skinfold measurements

### Types of Obesity

#### Central/visceral fat
Males: apple, android obesity
- males are 10 years most advanced in health risks when obese

Females: pear, gynoid

Upper body fat is pretty bad, testosterone and alcohol encourage upperbody fat
**Risks**
Death from all causes increases
Cardiovascular disease
Type 2 diabetes
Some cancers

#### Subcutaneous fat
Below the skin
stored in thighs, buttocks, abdomen
acts as an insulation

### Measurements
alongside the machines listed above, a waist circumference will help indicate when problems of visceral fat happen

The greater the amount of fat in a body, the greater the risk for:
- gallstones
- fatty liver
- hypertension
- heart diseases
- type 2 diabetes
- certain cancers
- inflammation
- premature death
- infertility
- sleep apnea
- artritis

## Defining a healthy body weight

weight is a risk factor for chronic illness
impacts metabolic fitness


## Genetic Factors
Genetics play a strong role in our obesity
One obese parent gives offpsring 40% chance of obesity in adulthood
Two obese parents - 80% risk of obesity

Genetics cannot explain how the obesity rates have spiked in recent decades
Other factors that are likely playing a part:
- Screens
- Availability of energy dense foods
- Food industies
- Culture of soda
- Stress levels
- etc.

## Healthy and Reliable Weight Management plans
- Incoprorates: Controlling energy intake, engage in positive lifestyle behaviours, perform regualr physical activity
- "Diet" carries with it a temporal behaviour, but maintenence of a healthy weight requires a healthy life sustained

Guidelines:
- do more than just restrict calories, increase physical activity
- adjuest calorie intake, even increase calories if needed to adjust for activity
- starvation will lead your body to consume it's lean muscle mass, which will mean losing the wrong weight, physical activity ensures lean muscle is maintained and increasesd
- adults need to move more and sit less
  - adults who move more often have greater bone density, more energy, better sleep, reduced risk of chronic disease

A sound eating plan has:
- The rate of weight loss is slow and consistent
  - rapid weight loss will weaken and sicken the body, and tissues of vital organs (Heart, lungs, liver) will be broken down to fuel the body as it reacts to what it thinks is a starvation time period.
  - more than 1 or 2 pounds lost a week is too high
- Plan should maintain a degree of flexibility, attend social events, eat cake, eat out, don't be entirely restricted
- Dietary pattern should be varied, with nutrient-dense food sources
  - no "magic" foods or pills

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)
- released from the ileum and colon in response to calorie intake
- inhibits food intake via vagus nerve
- effects:
  - slows gastric mobilityl
  - increases level of satiety
  - promotes insulin release
  - inhibits glucagon
  - inhibits release of gastric acid secretion

Successful weight losers:
- 78% eat breakfast
- 75% weight themselves at least once a week
- 60% watch less than 10 hrs of TV
- 90% exercise for 1 hr a day
