# Lipids

### Common Properties

Lipids solid at room temperature are called fats, lipids that are liquid are called oils
Lipid is a common term that includes: triglycerids, phospholipids, and sterols
Diverse group of chemical compouns made primarily from carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. 
Carbon-hydrogen bonds contain more engery, lipids have more of these than carbohydrates

### Functions

Storgae of energy
Insulation - temperature regulation
Protective padding around vital structures
Hormone structure, produciton requires lipids
Precursor to certain vitamins
Vitamin A, D, E, K are fat soluble and transported through the body by aid from fats
Helps in brain functions and nerve insulation

**Function in Food**

Carries the flavors, smells, and aromas of food
Increases satiety

Some fats may contribute to heart disease when eated in excess
Some fatty acids are essential nutirents and are productive


## Fatty Acids (a triglyceride)
### Differences in Fatty Acids

Degree in saturation (Saturated fat v unsaturated fat)
Unsaturated fat type (Monounsaturated and Polyunsaturate) has to do with concentration of fats present, amount of hydrogens bonded to the carbons in a fat. Mono have one carbon bond, poly have multiple

**Chain Length** 
Short chain (SCT) 2-4 carbons
Medium chain (MCT) 6-10 carbons
Large chain (LCT) 12+ carbons

**Location**
The locaiton of the double bond from the omega end, the carboxillic
The alpha end is the COOH group, where the oxygen is bonded to the molecule, the omega end is the carbon hydrogen end

### Monounsaturated fat

Decrease LDL, don't change the HDL
Avocado, Olive Oil
Heart healthy

### Polyunsaturated fat (PUFA)

Corn, soybean, sunflower
An essential fatty acid
Heart healthy
**The only Essential fats**
Alpha-linolenic acid (Omega 3)
- body uses them to make cell membranes, regulate blood vessel contraction and clotting, also made into compounds that support brain function and growth
- Flax seeds, cold water fish, canola oil, walnuts
Linoleic acid (Omega 6)
- made arachidonic acid, though linoleic acid are inflammatory
- Corn, safflower, soybean, mayo, chicken


### Cis and Trans fatty acids

In Cis fatty acids, there is a kink in the molecule, this is a natural fat Oleic
In Trans fats, the molecule is straight, this is the result of proccesing

### Trans fats

Partially hydrogenated oils have been banned since 2018, trans fats increase small-dense LDL, decrease HDL and increase inflammation.
Processed sources were nearly eliminated
Some animals produce CLAs from PUFAs in grass, but they are molecularly different from processed transfats

## Phospholipis

Lecithin - 
They are polar, hydrophobilc chain, they make up cell walls

## Sterols

Multiranged structure, no chains of fatty acids, but a ring structure
Makes cholesterol and phytosterols
Human bodies can make its own cholesterol, so it isn't essential
Sources of cholesterol are animal based, eggs, milk, 

Sources of phytosterols are plant based

## Fat digestion

**Mouth/salivary glands**
Produce salivary lipase that is activated in the stomach

**Stomach**
Produce gastric lipase

**Liver/gallbaldder**
Produces bile to aid in fat digestions

**Pancrease**
Releases pancreatic lipase to break down triglycerides into glycerol, etc.

**Small intestine**
Where most fat digestion and and absorption occurs
- **Small intestinal lining:
    Absorbs the borken down large fat droplets

**Transportation in the blood**
Lipoprotiens serve as transport of fats, made of a shell of phospholipids, they allow fat to move through the water-based bloodstream
  **Lipoprotien classes**
  - Chylomicorn: triglyceride, carries dietary fat to the cells from small intestine
  - VLDL: triglyceride, carries lipids made and taken up by the liver to cells
  - LDL: cholesterol, carries cholesterol made by the liver to the cells
  - HDL: protien, contributes to cholesterol removal from cells and the excretion of it from the body

## Heart Problems

### Atherolsclerosis
- high amounts of minerals, platelets, and oxidized LDL form a plaque in the damaged inner lining of arteries.
- White cells attatch to the cholesterol heap, foam, and calcify over the years
- Narrowed arteriy is at risk for clots, which causes strokes and loss of blood supply to areas of the body if clot tears off.

### Risk factors for cardiovascular disease
- Smoking
- Age > 65 (men > 45) (women > 55)
- Physical inactivity
- Excess body fat
- High blodd pressure
- High cholesterol
  - Elevated LDL, elevated triglycerides
- Family history
- Ethnicity
- Diabetes
- Chronic kidney disease
- Inflammatory diseases
- Males are at higher risk than females

**Dietarty/ Lifestyle and CVD**

Risks:
- diets high in calories, saturated fats, sodium, and added sugar
- diets low in fruits and vegetables

Recommendations:
- diets low in saturated fat, sodium, and added sugar
- diests high in fruits and vegetables
- whole grains
- Exercise! (150-300 min a week)
- **comsume more omega 3, and less omega 6 fats**
  - omega 3 lowers blood pressure, reduces blood clots, reduces inflammatino, increases HDL, reduces LDL and triclycerides, stabilize heart rythmns
  - People who eat 8oz of fish a week are at lower risk for heart disease
  - Mediterranean diet is pretty good (extra virgin olive oil)
