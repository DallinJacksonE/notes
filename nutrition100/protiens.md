# Protiens!

## Protien composition
20 types of amino acids make up all protiens
- contain nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, and qxygen
9 essential amino acids
11 nonessential amino acids
Protiens can be broken down to conserve energy
Protiens regulate and maintain body function (vision, cell repair, clotting, etc)

### Structure
Each amino acid has an acid group
A carbon skeleton
And an amino group ```NH2```

Proteins linked together are called peptides

## 9 Essential acids
- Histidine
- Isoleucine
- Leucine
- Lysine
- Methionine
- Phenylalanine
- Threonine
- Tryptophan
- Valine
 Your body struggles when yuo do not eat these essenial protiens, protien production slows, and eventually your tissues are broken down

## Protien Organization and Synthesis

Protiens form peptide bonds by linking their amino and acide groups
