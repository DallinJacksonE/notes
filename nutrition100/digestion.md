## Large Intestine, Colon
- Digestions of fiber
-   soluble fiber digestions makes shrot chain fatty acids, these help with the feeling of saitity
-   insoluble fiber remains undigested
-   Microbiota are in the large intestine

### Microbiota: the over 500 types of bactieria living in the large intestine
- Each human has 300 - 500 types of bacterial strains
- Varies person to person, more than 2,300 types have been identified
- 100 trillion of microbiota in the human body, outnumbers human cells 10 to 1
- The bacteria weighs 2-3 pounds
- Sometimes seen as a separate organ
- Separate genetic biome

### Functions of gut microbiome (the microbiota)
- Modulates the immune system
- Stimulates health of the intestinal cells
- Controls proliferation of harmful pathogens
- Energy metabolism
- Synthesize vitamins
- Likely communicate with the brain
- Potentially effect weight, bone density, emotions, normal bowel function, and more

## Celiac Disease
- Cronic autoimmune disease resulting in damage to the small instestine
- When gluten is absorped by the small intestine, the immune system wipes out the cells that have absorped it
- The only treatment is to not eat gluten in any form

### Nonceliac Gluten Sensitivity
- _Gluten intolerance_ or _gluten sensitivity_
**Experience symptoms after the digestion of gluten**
-   Fatigue
-   Bloating
-   Joint pain
-   Sleep disorders
**Treatment**
- Elimination of wheat, rye, and barley

## Nutrient Storage
- The human body maintains a store of nutrients to help us when we are not eating
- Fat is stored in the body in adipose tissue
- Glucose and glycogen are short term storages of carbs in the liver and muscle
- Vitamins and minerals: location and method varies
- Balanced diet is the safest means to acquire nutrients needed for optimal health

## Carbohydrates
- Main nutrient the human body uses for fuel, primarily from plants, since photosynthesis is what makes carbohydrates
```6C0<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>0 = C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>```
**Simple sugars**
  1. Glucose
  2. Fructose - 5 sides
  3. Galactose - flipped OH group

### Glucose
- Major monosaccharide in the body
- In table sugar, bonded to fructose
- called blood sugar in the bloodstream
- from starches and sucrose
- the fuel that cells use

### Fructose
- Fruit Sugar
- In fruit, honey, and high-f corn syrup
- Converted into glucose in the liver or fat if consumed in high amounts
- Beneficial when consumed in fruits

### Galactose
- Bonded to glucose in lactose (Milk sugar)
- Converted to glucose in the liver
- Made from glucose in the mammary gland during milk production
